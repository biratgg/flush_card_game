# Flush Card Game 🃏

Flush Card Game is a simple **Python-based card game** that simulates basic card game mechanics such as shuffling cards, dealing hands, and applying game logic.
This project is mainly created for **learning Python**, understanding **game logic**, and practicing **modular programming**.

---

## Features

* Card deck creation and shuffling
* Card display using images
* Game logic handled in separate modules
* Easy-to-read and beginner-friendly Python code
* Can be extended with more rules or a better UI

---

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Standard Python libraries

---

## Project Structure

```
flush_card_game/
├── images/
├── display_cards.py
├── home.py
├── logic.py
├── shuffle.py
└── README.md
```

### File Description

* **home.py** – Main entry point of the game
* **display_cards.py** – Handles card visualization
* **logic.py** – Contains game rules and decision logic
* **shuffle.py** – Manages deck creation and shuffling
* **images/** – Stores card images used in the game

## How to Run the Game

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/biratgg/flush_card_game.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd flush_card_game
```

3. Run the game:

```
python home.py
```

Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.

---

## How the Game Works

* A deck of cards is shuffled
* Cards are dealt to the player
* Game logic evaluates the cards
* Results are displayed based on Flush card rules

*(Rules can be expanded or modified in `logic.py`)*

---

## Future Improvements

* Add a graphical user interface (GUI)
* Implement smarter AI logic
* Add multiplayer support
* Improve game rules to fully match Flush gameplay
